# Reskilling the workforce

# StudentPlace

### Introduction
The student place project aims at providing a platform for students to sell their items through an auctioning system. The students will put up their products for sale amongst various categories and then buyers(students) will bid for the product during a time period.

### Abstract
The motivation of this project is to help students sell their products which might be useful to other students. There are currently no student specific platforms for selling the used items. This project aims to deliver a platform which connects the students and provide best price for a product to a seller.

### Approach
Input: What information are we going to get from the user?
Product details, Category, Expected Minimum and Maximum price. Details regarding transportation.
Process:
Once the details are provided by the user, a cooling period is provided before the product is put up for sale. Once the cooling period ends, the product appears on the listing in a specific category with a start time and the end time for the bidding. The user can then bid for the product. This bidding continues until the end period unless someone bids for the maximum price provided by the user, in which case the product is marked as sold and removing from the active bidding process. The bidder then gets a certain time to pay the amount either online or through cash when picking up, if the amount is no paid in that timeframe, then the item goes back to the bidding process.
Output: What will the output be for our users?
The item will be sold at the end of the auction period to the best bidder (price). 

###  Persona
Our intended audience will be looking to sell their products online. This project will help them connect with potential buyers for the best price.

# Course Recommendation System
###  Introduction: 
A web application that enables students to find the right courses for them based on their requirements and specifications.

###  Abstract: 
Currently there are many websites available offering numerous courses. It can be quite confusing as well as time consuming to go through all of them to find the right fit. Many parameters need to be considered before choosing the right course to study like the time duration, the content, cost as well as the reviews and rating. This project intends to ease the userâ€™s dilemma and reduce the time and effort that goes into searching, thereby allowing students to focus on learning.

###  Approach:
The user will have to input the requirements or the criteria.
A web crawler will be designed to crawl various websites and scrape data to apply filtering based on user specification.
Once the details are provided, the sites will be crawled and relevant output will be displayed. There will be links provided for them to be redirected to the preferred site to complete their registration.

### Personas: 
The end users will be students interested in pursuing online courses.

# Covid Tracker 
Develop Web application to inform the people who came in contact with Covid positive person.

###  Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. As of Sept 2021, it has taken more that 4.5 million lives worldwide. 
As per the Health experts, this pandemic is far from over and we must be ready for next Pandemic. To fight this pandemic and to get ready for next pandemic technology can play a vital role. 
One of the strategies to stop the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing. In this strategy, public health workers talk to people with COVID-19 to learn about all the people they were physically close to while they were potentially able to spread the disease. A people in contact to a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 should be notified of their exposure as soon as possible (within 24 hours of contact elicitation). Using the modern technology contract tracing could be more efficient and more effective. 
 
###  Abstract
In this Project we will work on How, with a help of technology we can make contact tracing more efficient, effective, and less tedious. 
In this approach we will develop a web application. So, for each public places like restaurant, shops, bus stops we can assign one code. So, before entering to these places user must scan this code. As soon as user enters the code an entry will be made in our database. Suppose if user tests positive for Covid 19, A medical officer or user himself can update in the web app that user is Covid 19 positive. After that, app will send an Automatic Email to all the users who were present in the places where user was present at same time in last 5 days. 
 
###  Approach 
We will be making use of MongoDB for all the database operations. To store users and to store the places user visited 
We will develop MERN Stack web application.  
This MVC (Model View Controller) architecture will help us in modularizing our code and separate out all our services, so that debugging and developing will be much easier, and the code will be much cleaner as well, hence aiding in maintaining it for a long term. 
 
### Persona 
This application will primarily have 2 personas: 
Medical Officers: Major responsibilities include updating user profile when they find user Covid 19 positive. 
Users: Major responsibilities include scanning the code before entering public places.
